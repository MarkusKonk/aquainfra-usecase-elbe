Weights are calculated based on the percentage of average urban class-specicif human popupation density out of the sum of all urban class-specific human population densities. The percentage is an average of the percentage values from two different approaches, since the CLC raster is finer (100m2 cells) compared to the Census Grid (1km2 cells). The first approach is based on general overlaps: using all urban CLC raster cells overlapping Census Grid cells. The second appraoch is based on full overlaps: using only urban CLC raster cells that overlap Census Grid cells containing only one unique urban CLC class. Each census grid value is divided equally out on each used CLC raster cell within it. Urban CLC classes are perceived as significant and kept when final weights >= 1.0 %.",
